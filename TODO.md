# Interview

Testing is important - but for brevity sake, we're not expecting any automated during the interview (until we get to that task)



1. Build an API endpoint that returns an author. (hardcoded author)


```json
{
  "id": 1, 
  "firstName": "Mark",
  "lastName": "Twain"
}
```


2. Build a new endpoint that saves an author to the H2 Database. (H2 is on the pom)
